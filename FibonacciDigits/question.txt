The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

F1 = 1
F2 = 1
F3 = 2
F4 = 3
F5 = 5
F6 = 8
F7 = 13
F8 = 21
F9 = 34
F10 = 55
F11 = 89
F12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

Write a function fibonacciDigits which takes in a number n and returns the index of the first term to contain n number of digits.

Input Format
Integer n: number of digits

Constraints
0 < n <= 100

Output Format
Integer: the index of the first term to contain n number of digits.
