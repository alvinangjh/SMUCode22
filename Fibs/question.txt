Fibonacci Numbers are a series of numbers that start from 0 and 1, and rely on the sum of the previous 2 numbers to calculate the remaining numbers in the sequence.

Write a function that takes in an integer n, and returns the nth fibonacci number in the sequence in an efficient manner.

We require the solution to be modulo by 2147483647 to prevent overflow.
