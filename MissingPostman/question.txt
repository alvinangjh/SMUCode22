The local-part of the email address must be in ascii characters. From a to Z, 0 to 9. Periods (.) are allowed provided that it is not the first or last character and that it does not appear consecutively. 

The domain part of the email address must be in ascii characters. From a to Z, 0 to 9. Periods and hyphens are allowed provided that it is not the first or last character and that it does not appear consecutively.
