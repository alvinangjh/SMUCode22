The knights have found themselves in yet another challenging bind once again. While searching for a bug, they have found themselves in lost in a 2D array. There is only one way to enter and leave the dungeon - by traversing it in a spiral anti-clockwise fashion.

Given an N x N array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, travelling anti-clockwise.
